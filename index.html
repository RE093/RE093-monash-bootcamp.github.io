                <br>
                <p id="column"> Hi, I'm Rupert, I am an ex-army diesel mechanic turned UX-design/ Full-Stack developer, always looking for a challenge and thriving in the process of solving the puzzle. I moved to Melbourne seeking a new adventure and a new lifestyle.
                    I think it is fair to say I got it. I am looking forward exploring Australia once all this Covid-19 business is over and seeing everything this country has to offer, while figuring out what I can offer in return.
                </p>
                <p>I am into all things outdoors, I have spent a fair amount of time sleeping under the stars and like to do so every so often to reflect on life. I am/ was a bit of a runner, I enjoy incorporating running into my everyday
                    life. I have run a marathon, numerous halfs and a half-Ironman with the goal being to complete a full before life's end. I also have a major passion for cars and anything mechanical, having spent most of my years so far 
                    working on one of the many many "future classics" I have owned, trying to make them go faster in one form or another.
